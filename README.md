# Rubik-s-Cube-V2
This is a new version of the same project.

In this totaly new software implementation the user won't need a PC and an Arduino anymore, and the only thing needed is a Telegram account. In fact, the Arduino board and the PC have been now replaced with a Raspberry Pi running a telegram Bot. You can set your own password to make sure your raspberry will be used by nobody except you.
